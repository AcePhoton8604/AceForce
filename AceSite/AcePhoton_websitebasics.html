        Hello there! I'm AcePhoton, which you probably already knew before clicking this, 
        probably through a personalized link, another one of my websites, or from the "about me" 
        page in discord. If not, I am confused as to what are you doing here.<BR>
        A lot of you probably clicked the link hoping to know more about me, AcePhoton. You will so, though if the information 
        you recieve is adequate for your purposes or not, that I cannot confirm
    </P>

                        It is a pretty long name that many people can't even pronounce properly. <BR>

                    <U><B>My age is [redacted]. </B> </U>   
                        Rest assured though, I am old enough to understand, yet young enough to not understand <BR>

                    <U><B> I live in [redacted country name].</B></U>    
                    I live in a country (surprise!). While I won't fo into much details, I will say that few actually remember the existence of this country.<BR>
