# License

Okayyy....

I never expected to have this repository made public so there isn't a direct license. Most of the stuff here isn't really exclusive or anything, so you are free to use it at will. Additionally, I intend to enhance [this CSS file](AceCode/EonsCSS.css)and make it more like an API or a Library (excuse me, I am unfamiliar with these particular terms), so it is kind-of intended to be used by everyone.

The images though, are a different story. ***You are not allowed to use these images under any circumstances without providing credit to the original owner, i.e me. This basically means you cannot clain credit to the images and cannot use it in any of your works without credit. I intend on adding watermarks to them in the future too.*** I can't really stop you from just using it as a wallpaper, so I don't really mind you doing so either.

As for [the models](AceModels), use them anyway you want. They're really just me figuring out blockbench.
