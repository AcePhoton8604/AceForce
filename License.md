# License

***O****kayyy....*

I never expected to have this repository made public for some reason so there isn't a direct license. Most of the stuff here isn't really exclusive or anything, so you are free to use it at will. Additionally, I intend to enhance [this CSS file](AceCode/EonsCSS.css) and make it more like a Library, so it is kind-of intended to be used by everyone.

The images though, are a different story. ***You are not allowed to use these images under any circumstances without providing credit to the original owner, i.e me. This basically means you cannot claim credit to the images and cannot use it in any of your works without credit. I intend on adding watermarks to them in the future too.*** I can't really stop you from just using it as a wallpaper though, so I don't really mind you doing so either. It'd be silly to do so even if I could stop you.

As for [the models](AceModels), use them anyway you want. They're really just me figuring out blockbench.

**A formal license might be added someday in the future, but I cannot confirm that.**
