# AceForce

Hello ðŸ‘‹!

I'm AcePhoton and I have a deep passion for coding. Unfortunately, I haven't been able to delve into my passion and my knowledge of code is extremely limited. Here, in this repository, I upload all the code files I, myself have coded in alongside inspirations for future projects. A lot of the code I have barely even worked on because my time in such things is limited

I have also uploaded my other works, including images, models, etc.

I am still very new to Github and the coding world in general, so I also want to use this repository as a platform to explore more of Github's features. Please forgive the very ammeteur and cluttered repository for this reason.

Lastly, any help in anything here will be appreciated. I can't stress enough on how I'm new to Github, how this is all supposed to be an archive of what I'm learning
and how I really, really want to work on this more.


*So I don't want any complaints on having Python, C++ and Java in the same place.*

Thanks for visiting. Have a good one!
