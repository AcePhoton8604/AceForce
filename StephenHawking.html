    He was the director at the <A HREF=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centre_for_Theoretical_Cosmology > Center for Theoretical Cosmology </A> at the <A HREF= https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Cambridge> University of Cambridge </A> at the time of his death. 
    <H3> Early Life </H3>
    Hawking was born in <A HREF= https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxford> Oxford </A> on the 8<sup>th</sup> of January, 1942 to Frank and Isobel Hawking.

    It is the black-body radiation that is theorized to be released by black holes because of quantum effects near the black hole event horizon. 
    It is the most well-known of Hawking's Contributions.<BR> 
    <A HREF= https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_hole_information_paradox> <B><I> Black Hole Information Paradox </I> </B> </A>
    The paradox that says that information is lost inside black holes, even though that is scientifically impossible. <BR>
    <A HREF= <A HREF= https://doi.org/10.17863/CAM.11283><B><I> Evidence of the Big Bang Theory </I></B></A>
    Hawking mathematically proved that the Big Bang actually did happen. <BR>
    <H3> Death </H3>
    Professor Hawking had suffered from <A HREF= https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/motor-neurone-disease/#:~:text=Motor%20neurone%20disease%20(MND)%20is,the%20condition%20for%20many%20years.> Motor Neurone Disease </A> since the age of 21. 
    Even though it's progress had considerably slowed down, it eventually did lead to his death. He died at his home in <A HREF= https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambridge> Cambridge </A> on 14 <sup>th </sup> March 2018.

    <BR>
    <BR> <A HREF= https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brief_History_of_Time><B> A Brief History of Time- </B></A> A book dedicated to explaining the facts of science to the less science-oriented people.
    <BR> <A HREF= https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atheism><B> Atheism- </B></A> Hawking was an atheist and provided many scientific arguments and debates on the existence of god.
    <BR> <B> Predictions- </B> Hawking predicted several things about the future of humanity; from artificial intelligence, to the end of the world.
    <BR> <B> Others- </B> He was eulogised by figures in science, entertainment, politics, and other areas.
